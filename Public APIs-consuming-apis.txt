With API week coming up next week, here are some free public APIs you may enjoy sharing with your students:

HTTP://API.SHOUTCLOUD.IO/V1/SHOUT (good basic demo that switches anything you POST to it into ALL CAPS)
http://deckofcardsapi.com (might tie in well with earlier deck of cards demos)

Two "reflective" APIs that are good for testing HTTP requests of various types:
https://httpbin.org
https://httpstat.us/

Fun (Pokemon, Star Wars, Harry Potter)
https://pokeapi.co
https://swapi.dev/
https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html

Potentially useful for side projects or capstones
https://date.nager.at/Api (list public holidays for any country and year)
https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>
https://quickchart.io/documentation/ (create charts and graphs from POSTed data)
https://goqr.me/api/doc/create-qr-code/ (create QR codes for any text or url)

All of those APIs are open and don't require any kind of key or authentication. A couple more free APIs with interesting data that require registering for a free key are:
https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm (National Park Service)
https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html (USDA food data)
