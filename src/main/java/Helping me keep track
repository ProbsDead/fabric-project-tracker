size conversions will now happen in their respective sub classes

Write to file will also happen in their respective class I need to figure out how
to build that method in the super class to be overrideable without having to repeat
a bunch of code

How does input and output work with inheritance?

Do I want to build two separate methods one for reading and building into an
object and one for writing.  It seems that would follow the rules of
encapsulation more and would make it easier to make changes down the road.
